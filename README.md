## Project Overview
The Electric Vehicle Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market, highlighting key trends and insights through interactive visualizations. The dashboard presents data on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on market dynamics.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were identified to assess the EV market:

1. **Total Vehicles**: Overall count of electric vehicles, including BEVs and PHEVs.
2. **Average Electric Range**: Assessment of the average electric range of vehicles to gauge technological advancements.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total**: Analysis of the total number of BEVs and their percentage relative to total electric vehicles.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total**: Analysis of the total number of PHEVs and their percentage relative to total electric vehicles.

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard consists of various components designed to present critical information clearly and effectively:

1. **General Vehicle Information Section**
   - Components: Summary of vehicle models and types.
   - Purpose: Provide a foundational overview of the dataset.

2. **Overall Performance Indicator**
   - Components: Key metrics showcasing market performance.
   - Purpose: Highlight significant market trends and performance indicators.

3. **Time-Based Analyses**
   - Components: Trends over time, such as vehicle adoption rates.
   - Purpose: Offer insights into growth patterns in the EV market.

## Visualizations
The dashboard utilizes diverse visualization types to effectively communicate data insights:

1. **Bar Charts**: Compare key metrics, such as top manufacturers and vehicle models.
2. **Line Graphs**: Illustrate trends over time, highlighting the growth of electric vehicles.
3. **Word Clouds**: Visualize popular models or terms associated with EVs (if applicable).
4. **Box Plots**: Analyze distribution and variability in electric range data.
5. **Pie Charts**: Show proportions of vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
6. **Tree Maps**: Display hierarchical data regarding the top vehicle models.
7. **Map Charts**: Illustrate the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across states.

## Tools and Technologies
The project was developed using the following tools and technologies:
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Sources**: (Specify any datasets or APIs used, if applicable).
- **Additional Technologies**: (Mention any other relevant technologies used in the project).

## Installation and Setup
To run this project locally:
1. Install Tableau (if not already installed).
2. Download the dataset (provide a link or instructions on where to obtain it).
3. Open Tableau and connect to the dataset.
4. Import the dashboard file (if applicable) to view the visualizations.

Thank you for your interest in the Electric Vehicle Dashboard project! We hope you find it valuable in understanding the dynamics of the electric vehicle market.
